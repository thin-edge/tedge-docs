description: Details of the API to manage software on a device
---

%%te%% software management is implemented by two operations
which give the ability to manage software packages of different types on the same device.

- `software_list` is used to fetch a pertinent subset of the software packages installed on a device.
- `software_update` let the user install, update and remove software packages on a device.

## software_list MQTT API

The `software_list` operation API follows the [generic %%te%% rules for operations](device-management-api.md):
- The `te/<device-topic-id>/cmd/software_list` topic is used to publish the type of software packages
  that can be managed on the device with the given topic identifier.
- Each `te/<device-topic-id>/cmd/software_list/+` topic is dedicated to a software list command instance,
- The workflow is [generic with `"init"`, `"executing"`, `"successful"` and `"failed"` statuses](references/agent/device-management-api.md#operation-workflow).

### Operation registration

The registration message of the `software_list` operation on a device:
- must provide a `types` list of the types of software package that can be installed on this device (e.g. `["apt", "docker"]`)
- can provide a description of the operation and of each supported package type.

```sh te2mqtt formats=v1
tedge mqtt pub --retain 'te/device/child001///cmd/software_list' '{
    "description": "List software packages installed on the device",
    "types": [
      "apt",
      "docker"
    ]
}'
```

### init state

A `software_list` command has nothing to provide beyond a `status` field.
This empty message stands for a request of the list of software currently installed.

```sh te2mqtt formats=v1
tedge mqtt pub --retain 'te/device/child001///cmd/software_list/c8y-2023-09-25T14:34:00' '{
    "status": "init"
}'
```

### executing state

Just before starting the command execution, the agent marks the command as executing
by publishing a retained message that repeats the former command except that:

- the `status` is set to `executing`

### successful state

The payload for a successful `software_list` command has two fields:

- the `status` is set to `successful`
- a `currentSoftwareList` field is added with the *new* list of packages installed on the device
    - These packages are grouped by software package type:
       ```json
       {
          "currentSoftwareList": [
            {
              "type": "apt",
              "modules": [ "..." ]
            },
            {
              "type": "docker",
              "modules": [ "..." ]
            }
         ]
      }
      ```
    - Each installed package is given:
        - the package `"name"`,
        - the installed `"version"`.

As an example, here is a (simplified) status message for a successful `software_list` command on a child device:

```sh te2mqtt formats=v1
tedge mqtt pub --retain 'te/device/child001///cmd/software_list/c8y-2023-09-25T14:34:00' '{
    "status": "successful",
    "currentSoftwareList": [
        {
            "type": "debian",
            "modules": [
                {
                    "name": "nodered",
                    "version": "1.0.0",
                },
                {
                    "name": "collectd",
                    "version": "5.12"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "type": "docker",
            "modules": [
                {
                    "name": "nginx",
                    "version": "1.21.0",
                },
            ]
        }
    ]
}'
```

### failed state

The payload for a failed `software_list` is made of two fields:

- the `status` is set to `failed`
- a `reason` text field is added with the root cause of the failure

```sh te2mqtt formats=v1
tedge mqtt pub --retain 'te/device/child001///cmd/software_list/c8y-2023-09-25T14:34:00' '{
    "status": "failed",  
    "reason": "Permission denied",
}'
```

## software_update MQTT API

The `software_update` operation API follows the [generic %%te%% rules for operations](device-management-api.md):
- The `te/<device-topic-id>/cmd/software_update` topic is used to publish the type of software packages
  that can be managed on the device with the given topic identifier.
- Each `te/<device-topic-id>/cmd/software_update/+` topic is dedicated to a software update command instance,
  and is used to publish the subsequent states of the command execution.
- The workflow is [generic with `"init"`, `"executing"`, `"successful"` and `"failed"` statuses](references/agent/device-management-api.md#operation-workflow).

### Operation registration

The registration message of the `software_update` operation on a device:
- must provide a `types` list of the types of software package that can be installed on this device (e.g. `["apt", "docker"]`)
- can provide a description of the operation and of each supported package type.

```sh te2mqtt formats=v1
tedge mqtt pub --retain 'te/device/child001///cmd/software_update' '{
    "description": "Install, update and remove software packages",
    "types": [
      "apt",
      "docker"
    ]
}'
```

:::info
The software types are currently not sent to the cloud (e.g. Cumulocity IoT), however this is planned in a future release.
:::

### init state

A `software_update` command is defined by an `"updateList"` array giving the packages to install, update or remove.

- The `"updateList"` field is a list of software update actions.
  - These actions are grouped by software package type:
     ```json
     {"updateList": [
        {
            "type": "apt",
            "modules": [ "..." ]
        },
        {
            "type": "docker",
            "modules": [ "..." ]
        }
    ]}
     ```
   - Each action is either to `"install"` or `"remove"` a software package.
      - `"action": "install"` is to be understood as a goal:
        "this package must be installed with this version" whatever the actual action to reach this goal,
        being a fresh install, an upgrade or a downgrade.
      - `"action": "remove"` is also to be understood as a goal: "that package must not be installed".
   - An action provides:
      - the package `"name"` (as known by the package packager),
      - optionally a `"version"` (using the same conventions as the package manager),
      - optionally an `"url"` from where to download the package.

As an example, here is a message requesting a `software_update` on a child device:

```sh te2mqtt formats=v1
tedge mqtt pub --retain 'te/device/child001///cmd/software_update/c8y-2023-09-25T14:53:00' '{
    "status": "init",
    "updateList": [
        {
            "type": "apt",
            "modules": [
                {
                    "name": "nodered",
                    "version": "1.0.0",
                    "action": "install"
                },
                {
                    "name": "collectd",
                    "version": "5.12",
                    "url": "https://collectd.org/download/collectd-tarballs/collectd-5.12.0.tar.bz2",
                    "action": "install"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "type": "docker",
            "modules": [
                {
                    "name": "nginx",
                    "version": "1.21.0",
                    "action": "install"
                },
                {
                    "name": "mongodb",
                    "version": "4.4.6",
                    "action": "remove"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}'
```

### executing state

Just before starting the command execution, the agent marks the command as executing
by publishing a retained message that repeats the former command except that:

- the `status` is set to `executing`

### successful state

The payload for a successful `software_update` command
repeats the same content as the former request except that:

- the `status` is set to `successful`.

As an example, here is a status message for a successful `software_update` command on a child device:

```sh te2mqtt formats=v1
tedge mqtt pub --retain 'te/device/child001///cmd/software_update/c8y-2023-09-25T14:53:00' '{
    "status": "successful",  
    "updateList": [
        {
            "type": "apt",
            "modules": [
                {
                    "name": "nodered",
                    "version": "1.0.0",
                    "action": "install"
                },
                {
                    "name": "collectd",
                    "version": "5.12",
                    "url": "https://collectd.org/download/collectd-tarballs/collectd-5.12.0.tar.bz2",
                    "action": "install"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "type": "docker",
            "modules": [
                {
                    "name": "nginx",
                    "version": "1.21.0",
                    "action": "install"
                },
                {
                    "name": "mongodb",

                    "action": "remove"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]

```

### failed state

The payload for a failed `software_update` command
repeats the same content as the former request except that:

- the `status` is set to `failed`
- a `reason` text field is added with the root cause of the failure
- a `failures` array field might be added to list the errors for all the failing actions.

```sh te2mqtt formats=v1
tedge mqtt pub --retain 'te/device/child001///cmd/software_update/c8y-2023-09-25T14:53:00' '{

                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}'
```

## tedge-agent implementation

### Software management plugins

The `tedge-agent` service uses software management plugins to interact with the actual package managers.

For each type of software package supported on the device must be provided a specific software management plugin:

- A plugin is an executable file implementing the [software plugin API](../software-management-plugin-api.md),
  to `list`, `install` and `remove` software packages of a specific type.
- These plugins are looked up by `tedge-agent` in the plugin directory (`/etc/tedge/sm-plugins` if not specified otherwise).
- `tedge-agent` uses the file name of a plugin executables as the software package type name.

### Settings

`tedge-agent` behavior on `software_update` commands can be configured with `tedge config`.

- `software.plugin.default` sets the default software plugin to be used for software management on the device. 
- `software.plugin.max_packages` sets the maximum number of software packages reported for each type of software package.
- `software.plugin.exclude` sets the filtering criterion that excludes software packages from the output list if they match the pattern.
- `software.plugin.include` sets the filtering criterion that includes software packages in the output list if they match the pattern.

:::info
Include pattern takes precedence over exclude pattern, so when both are used at the same time, the software list will exclude packages according to the pattern but keep the exceptions covered by the include pattern.
:::

## Custom implementation

%%te%% users can implement their own support for software management to address the specificities of their devices.
- This can be done leveraging the `tedge-agent` and implementing a custom [software plugin](../software-management-plugin-api.md).
- If for some reasons the `tedge-agent` cannot run on the target hardware,
  then a service must be implemented to support the `software_list` and `software_update` operation, as described below.
  In this case, the service is free to choose its own mechanisms to manage software packages
  and can even run on a device that is not the target hardware.
