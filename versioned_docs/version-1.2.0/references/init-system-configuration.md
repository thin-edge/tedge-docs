description: Configuring %%te%% to work with Linux init systems
---

To support multiple init systems and service managers, `tedge` requires the `/etc/tedge/system.toml` file.
The file contains configurations about the init system and the supported actions.

The format of the file is:

```toml title="file: /etc/tedge/system.toml"
[init]
name = "systemd"
is_available = ["/bin/systemctl", "--version"]
restart = ["/bin/systemctl", "restart", "{}"]
stop =  ["/bin/systemctl", "stop", "{}"]
start =  ["/bin/systemctl", "start", "{}"]
enable =  ["/bin/systemctl", "enable", "{}"]
disable =  ["/bin/systemctl", "disable", "{}"]
is_active = ["/bin/systemctl", "is-active", "{}"]
```

:::info
For security reasons, the `system.toml` file should not be writable by non-root users. The permissions on the file can be set using the following command:

```sh
sudo chmod 644 /etc/tedge/system.toml
```
:::

## Placeholder

`{}` will be replaced by a service name (`mosquitto`, `tedge-mapper-c8y`, `tedge-mapper-az`, `tedge-mapper-aws`, etc.).
For example,

```toml
restart = ["/bin/systemctl", "restart", "{}"]
```

will be interpreted as

```sh
/bin/systemctl restart mosquitto
```

| `restart`      | The command to restart a service by the init system                                                  |

## Default settings

If the `system.toml` file does not exist, then %%te%% will assume that you are using Systemd, and use `/bin/systemctl` to control the services.
