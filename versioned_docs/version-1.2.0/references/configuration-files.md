description: Using a custom configuration path
---

%%te%% requires config files for its operation. The `tedge init` command is used to create
the base directory and other directories inside the base directory with appropriate user and permissions.
The `tedge-mapper` and `tedge-agent` will create the config
directories/files inside the base directory that are required for their operation on startup.

By default, the config files are created in `/etc/tedge` directory. To create the config files in
a custom base directory one has to use `--config-dir <Path to base directory>` option.

## Creating config files

The config files are created using `tedge init` as below.

```sh
sudo tedge init
```

All the directories will be created in the `/etc/tedge` directory. The directories layout looks as below.

```sh
ls -l /etc/tedge
```

```text title="Output"
total 16
drwxrwxr-x 2 mosquitto mosquitto 4096 Jun 10 14:49 device-certs
drwxrwxr-x 2 mosquitto mosquitto 4096 Jun 10 14:49 mosquitto-conf
drwxrwxr-x 2 tedge     tedge     4096 Jun 10 14:49 operations
drwxrwxr-x 2 tedge     tedge     4096 Jun 10 14:49 plugins
```

Use the below command to create the config directories in a custom directory.

```sh
sudo tedge --config-dir /global/path/to/config/dir init
```

Now all the config directories will be created inside the `/global/path/to/config/dir` directory.

The directories and files that are required by the `tedge-mapper` are created as below.

```sh
sudo tedge-mapper c8y
```

```sh
ls -l /etc/tedge/operations/c8y
```

```text title="Output"
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 tedge tedge 0 Jun 14 14:37 c8y_Restart
-rw-r--r-- 1 tedge tedge 0 Jun 14 14:37 c8y_SoftwareUpdate
```

To create these directories in a custom directory, use `--config-dir` option as below.

```sh
sudo tedge-mapper --config-dir /global/path/to/config/dir c8y
```

The directories and files that are required by the `tedge-agent` are created on startup as follows:

```sh
ls -l /etc/tedge/.agent
```

```text title="Output"
-rw-r--r-- 1 tedge tedge 0 Jun 15 11:51 /etc/tedge/.agent/current-operation
```

```sh
ls -l /var/tedge/
```

```text title="Output"
drwxr-xr-x 2 tedge tedge 0 Jun 15 11:51 /var/tedge/file-transfer
```

To create these directories and files in a custom directory, use the `--config-dir` option as below as below.

```sh
sudo tedge-agent --config-dir /global/path/to/config/dir
```

## Manage the configuration parameters

The configuration parameters can be set/unset/list in a config file as below

For example, the config parameter can be set as below.

```sh
sudo tedge config set c8y.url your.cumulocity.io
```

Now the configuration will be added into `/etc/tedge/tedge.toml`

Use the below command to set/unset/list configuration parameters in a config file that is present
in a custom directory.

```sh
sudo tedge --config-dir /global/path/to/config/dir config set c8y.url your.cumulocity.io
```

Now the config will be set in `/global/path/to/config/dir/tedge/tedge.toml`

## Manage the certificate

To create/remove/upload the certificate, one can use the below command.

```sh
sudo tedge cert create --device-id thinedge
```

```text title="Output"
Certificate was successfully created
```

Find the certificates that are created as below.

```sh
ls -l /etc/tedge/device-certs/
```

```text title="Output"
total 8
-r--r--r-- 1 mosquitto mosquitto 638 Jun 14 14:38 tedge-certificate.pem
-r-------- 1 mosquitto mosquitto 246 Jun 14 14:38 tedge-private-key.pem
```

Use the below command to create/remove/upload the certificate.

```sh
sudo tedge --config-dir /global/path/to/config/dir cert create --device-id thinedge
```

Find the certificates that are created as below.

```sh
ls -l /global/path/to/config/dir/tedge/device-certs/
```

```text title="Output"
total 8
-r--r--r-- 1 mosquitto mosquitto 638 Jun 14 14:38 tedge-certificate.pem
-r-------- 1 mosquitto mosquitto 246 Jun 14 14:38 tedge-private-key.pem
```

## Connecting to the cloud

Use the`tedge connect c8y/az/aws` command to connect to the cloud using the default configuration files
that are present in `/etc/tedge`.

To connect to the cloud with config files that are present in a custom location use
the `tedge connect --config-dir <Path to custom dir> c8y/az/aws` option.

This is a two step process.

### Step 1: Update the mosquitto.conf

Since the bridge configuration files for Cumulocity IoT, Azure IoT Hub or AWS IoT will be created in a directory given through `--config-dir`,
the path to the bridge configuration files (tedge-mosquitto.conf, c8y/az/aws-bridge.conf) must be found by `mosquitto`.
So, the below line has to be added to your `mosquitto.conf` file manually.

```text title="file: /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf"
include_dir /global/path/to/config/dir/tedge/mosquitto-conf
```

### Step 2: tedge connect using a custom config directory

Use the below command to connect to `Cumulocity IoT, Azure IoT Hub or AWS IoT` cloud using `--config-dir`

```sh
sudo tedge --config-dir /global/path/to/config/dir connect c8y/az/aws
```

Here the `path/to/config/dir` is the directory where the configuration files are present.
