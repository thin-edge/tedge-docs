description: How to get log files from %%te%% components
---

The logs that are useful for debugging %%te%% break down into logs that are created by %%te%% itself and by third party components.

## %%te%% logs {#thin-edge-logs}
On a %%te%% device different components like mappers, agent, and plugins run. The log messages of these components can be accessed as below.
The logs here capture INFO, WARNING, and ERROR messages.

### Cloud mapper logs {#mapper}
The %%te%% cloud mapper component that sends the measurement data to the cloud can be accessed as below.

#### Cumulocity mapper {#c8y-mapper}
The log messages of the Cumulocity mapper component that sends the measurement data from the %%te%% device to the Cumulocity
cloud can be accessed as below

```sh
journalctl -u tedge-mapper-c8y
```

:::note
Run `tedge-mapper --debug c8y` to log more debug messages
:::

#### Azure mapper {#az-mapper}
The log messages of the Azure mapper component that sends the measurement data from the %%te%% device to the Azure
cloud can be accessed as below.

```sh
journalctl -u tedge-mapper-az
```

:::note
Run `tedge-mapper --debug az` to log more debug messages
:::

#### AWS mapper {#aws-mapper}
The log messages of the AWS mapper component that sends the measurement data from the %%te%% device to the AWS
cloud can be accessed as below.

```sh
journalctl -u tedge-mapper-aws
```

:::note
Run `tedge_mapper --debug aws` to log more debug messages
:::

### Device monitoring logs {#device-logs}
The %%te%% device monitoring component logs can be found as below

#### Collectd mapper logs {#collectd-mapper}
The log messages of the collectd mapper that sends the monitoring data to the cloud can be accessed as below

```sh
journalctl -u tedge-mapper-collectd
```

:::note
Run `tedge-mapper --debug collectd` to log more debug messages
:::

### Software Management logs {#software-management}
This section describes how to access the software management component logs

#### Software update operation log {#software-update}
For every new software operation (list/update), a new log file will be created at `/var/log/tedge/agent`.
For each `plugin command` like prepare, update-list (install, remove), finalize, and list,
the log file captures `exit status, stdout, and stderr` messages.

#### tedge-agent logs {#tedge-agent-logs}
The agent service logs can be accessed as below

```sh
journalctl -u tedge-agent
```

For example: tedge-agent logs plugin calls finalize and list.

```log title="Logs"
tedge-agent : TTY=unknown ; PWD=/tmp ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/etc/tedge/sm-plugins/apt finalize
tedge-agent : TTY=unknown ; PWD=/tmp ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/etc/tedge/sm-plugins/apt list
```

:::note
Run `tedge-agent --debug` to log more debug messages
:::

## Thirdparty component logs {#thirdparty}
%%te%% uses the third-party components `Mosquitto` as the mqtt broker and `Collectd` for monitoring purpose.
The logs that are created by these components can be accessed on a %%te%% device as below.

### Mosquitto logs {#mosquitto}
%%te%% uses `Mosquitto` as the `mqtt broker` for local communication as well as to communicate with the cloud.
The `Mosquitto` logs can be found in `/var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log`.
`Mosquitto` captures error, warning, notice, information, subscribe, and unsubscribe messages.

:::note
Set `log_type debug` or `log_type all` on `/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`, to capture more debug information.
:::

### Collectd logs {#collectd}
`Collectd` is used for monitoring the resource status of a %%te%% device.
Collectd logs all the messages at `/var/log/syslog`.
So, the collectd specific logs can be accessed using the `journalctl` as below

```sh
journalctl -u collectd
```

## Configuring log levels in %%te%% {#configure-log-levels}

The log levels can be configured for %%te%% services using either by command line or setting the required log
level in `system.toml`

### Setting the log level through cli {#configure-log-levels-cli}

The log level can be enabled for a %%te%% service as below

For example for tedge-mapper:

```sh
sudo -u tedge -- tedge-mapper --debug c8y
```

:::note
In a similar way it can be set for all the %%te%% services.
Only `debug` level can be set through cli. Also, it enables `trace` level.
:::

### Setting log level through system.toml {#configure-log-levels-file}
The log levels can also be configured through the `system.toml` file.
The supported log levels are `info, warn, error, trace, debug`.

```toml title="file: /etc/tedge/system.toml"
[log]
tedge-mapper = "trace"
tedge-agent = "info"
```

:::note
The log level strings are case insensitive
