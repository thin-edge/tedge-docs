description: Overview of the fundamental components that make up the %%te%% agent
---

%%te%% agent is a set of services that implement the device management operations on a device.
Examples of such device management functionality include:
- software management, checking installed packages and updating these packages
- configuration management, checking and updating configuration files
- firmware management, updating the firmware of the device
- device restart
- remote access to a console on the device from the cloud
- log file management, retrieving excerpts from log files

:::note
In the current version of %%te%%, the agent features are not implemented by a single executable,
but by a set of executables:

- `tedge-agent`
- `c8y-firmware-plugin`
- `c8y-remote-access-plugin`

The short-term plan is to re-organize these plugins to move the Cumulocity aspects into the Cumulocity mapper
and to group the management operations into a single executable. 
:::

%%te%% agent acts as a device connector:
- listening to operation requests published on the MQTT bus
- delegating the actual operations to the operating system or other components
- reporting progress of the requests

## Operation MQTT topics

Operation requests are published by the requesters on operation specific topics. The topic scheme for commands can be visualized using the diagram below.

```mermaid
graph LR
  te --/--- identifier --/--- cmd
  subgraph root
    te
  end

  subgraph identifier
    identifier2["&lt;identifier&gt;"]
  end

  subgraph command
    direction LR
    cmd --/--- cmd_type["&lt;cmd_type&gt;"] --/--- cmd_id["&lt;cmd_id&gt;"]
  end

```

Where the command segments are describe as follows:

|Segment|Description|
|---|----|
|&lt;identifier&gt;|The [identifier](../references/mqtt-api.md#group-identifier) (e.g. device/service) associated with the command.|
|&lt;cmd_type&gt;|Command type. Each command can define its own payload schema to allow commands to have parameters related to the command's function.|
|&lt;cmd_id&gt;|Unique command id which is unique for the command instance. e.g. `123456`, `d511a86cab95be81` etc.|

### Command examples

The following table details some example command types which are supported by %%te%%.

| Command Type    | Description | Example Topic                                  |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| software_list   | Get the list of installed software | `te/<identifier>/cmd/software_list/<cmd_id>`   |
| software_update | Install/remove software | `te/<identifier>/cmd/software_update/<cmd_id>` |
| config_snapshot | Get configuration | `te/<identifier>/cmd/config_snapshot/<cmd_id>` |
| config_update   | Set/update configuration | `te/<identifier>/cmd/config_update/<cmd_id>`   |
| restart         | Restart device | `te/<identifier>/cmd/restart/<cmd_id>`         |
| log_upload      | Upload log file/s | `te/<identifier>/cmd/log_upload/<cmd_id>`      |

The command would be interpreted differently based on the target entity.
For example, the `restart` could mean either a device restart or a service restart based on the target entity.
