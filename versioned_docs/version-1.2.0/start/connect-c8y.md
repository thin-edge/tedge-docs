#### User Context {#user-context}

You can customize the documentation and commands shown on this page by providing relevant settings which will be reflected in the instructions. It makes it even easier to explore and use %%te%%.

<UserContextForm settings="DEVICE_ID,C8Y_URL,C8Y_USER" />

The user context will be persisted in your web browser's local storage.
:::

The very first step to enable %%te%% is to connect your device to the cloud.
* This is a 10 minutes operation to be done only once.
* It establishes a permanent connection from your device to the cloud end-point.
* This connection is secure (encrypted over TLS), and the two peers are identified by x509 certificates.
* Sending data to the cloud will then be as simple as sending data locally.

The focus is here on connecting to [Cumulocity IoT](https://www.cumulocity.com/guides/concepts/introduction/).
See this [tutorial](connect-azure.md), if you want to connect Azure IoT instead.
See this [tutorial](connect-aws.md), if you want to connect AWS IoT instead.

Before you try to connect your device to Cumulocity IoT, you need:
* The url of the endpoint to connect (e.g. `eu-latest.cumulocity.com`).
* Your credentials to connect Cumulocity:
    * Your tenant identifier (e.g. `t00000007`), a user name and password.
    * None of these credentials will be stored on the device.
    * These are only required once, to register the device.

If not done yet, [install %%te%% on your device](../install/index.md).

You can now use the [`tedge` command](../references/cli/index.md) to:
* [create a certificate for you device](connect-c8y.md#create-the-certificate),
* [make the device certificate trusted by Cumulocity](connect-c8y.md#make-the-device-trusted-by-cumulocity),
* [connect the device](connect-c8y.md#connect-the-device), and
* [send your first telemetry data](#sending-your-first-telemetry-data).

## Configure the device

To connect the device to the Cumulocity IoT, one needs to set the URL of your Cumulocity IoT tenant and the root certificate as below.

Set the URL of your Cumulocity IoT tenant.

<UserContext>

```sh
sudo tedge config set c8y.url $C8Y_URL
```

</UserContext>

Set the path to the root certificate if necessary. The default is `/etc/ssl/certs`.

```sh
sudo tedge config set c8y.root_cert_path /etc/ssl/certs
```

This will set the root certificate path of the Cumulocity IoT.
In most of the Linux flavors, the certificate will be present in `/etc/ssl/certs`.
If not found download it from [here](https://www.identrust.com/dst-root-ca-x3).

### Custom domain

If you are using the Cumulocity Iot [custom domain feature](https://cumulocity.com/docs/enterprise-tenant/customization/#domain-name), then you need to set two urls instead of one, as the HTTP and MQTT endpoints on custom domains are different because the custom domain only applies to the HTTP endpoint. The MQTT endpoint must point to the underlying Cumulocity IoT instance.

For example, below shows setting the HTTP and MQTT endpoints:

<UserContext>

```sh
tedge config set c8y.http "$C8Y_URL"
tedge config set c8y.mqtt "t12345.cumulocity.com:8883"
```

</UserContext>

:::tip
If you have `curl` and `jq` installed, then you can check if you are using a custom domain by executing the following command. If the response includes a different domain than the url used in the curl command, then you are using a custom domain, and you should use the output to set the `c8y.mqtt` thin-edge.io setting instead.

<UserContext>

```sh
curl -sfL https://$C8Y_URL/tenant/loginOptions | jq -r '.loginOptions[] | select(.loginRedirectDomain) | .loginRedirectDomain'
```
</UserContext>

:::


## Connecting to Cumulocity server signed with self-signed certificate

If the Cumulocity IoT instance that you're connecting to, is signed with a self-signed certificate(eg: Cumulocity IoT Edge instance),
then the path to that server certificate must be set as the c8y.root_cert_path as follows:

```sh
sudo tedge config set c8y.root_cert_path /path/to/the/self-signed/certificate
```

:::info
This is the certificate chain of the server and not the device's certificate kept at `/etc/tedge/device-certs` directory.
:::

If the Cumulocity server's certificate chain file isn't available locally, it can be downloaded using a web browser or using some other
third-party tools like openssl command as follows:

<UserContext>

```sh
openssl s_client -connect $C8Y_URL:443 < /dev/null 2>/dev/null \
| sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p'
```

</UserContext>

## Create the certificate

The `tedge cert create` command creates a self-signed certificate which can be used for testing purpose.

A single argument is required: an identifier for the device.
This identifier will be used to uniquely identify your devices among others in your cloud tenant.
This identifier will be also used as the Common Name (CN) of the certificate.
Indeed, this certificate aims to authenticate that this device is actually the device with that identity.

<UserContext>

```sh
sudo tedge cert create --device-id "$DEVICE_ID"
```

</UserContext>

```text title="Output"
Certificate was successfully created
```

You can then check the content of that certificate.

```sh
sudo tedge cert show
```

<UserContext>

```text title="Output"
Device certificate: /etc/tedge/device-certs/tedge-certificate.pem
Subject: CN=$DEVICE_ID, O=Thin Edge, OU=Test Device
Issuer: CN=$DEVICE_ID, O=Thin Edge, OU=Test Device
Valid from: Tue, 09 Feb 2021 17:16:52 +0000
Valid up to: Tue, 11 May 2021 17:16:52 +0000
Thumbprint: CDBF4EC17AA02829CAC4E4C86ABB82B0FE423D3E
```

</UserContext>

You may notice that the issuer of this certificate is the device itself.
This is a self-signed certificate.
To use a certificate signed by your Certificate Authority,
see the reference guide of [`tedge cert`](../references/cli/tedge-cert.md).

## Make the device trusted by Cumulocity

For a certificate to be trusted by Cumulocity,
one needs to add the certificate of the signing authority to the list of trusted certificates.
In the Cumulocity GUI, navigate to "Device Management/Management/Trusted certificates"
in order to see this list for your Cumulocity tenant.

Here, the device certificate is self-signed and has to be directly trusted by Certificate.
This can be done:
* either with the GUI: upload the certificate from your device (`/etc/tedge/device-certs/tedge-certificate.pem`)
  to your tenant "Device Management/Management/Trusted certificates".
* or using the `tedge cert upload c8y` command.

<UserContext>

```sh
sudo tedge cert upload c8y --user "$C8Y_USER"
```

</UserContext>

### Common errors

Below shows some common errors that can be experienced when trying to upload the device certificate.

#### InvalidCertificate(NotValidForName)

If you receive the following error, then you are most likely using the [custom domain feature](https://cumulocity.com/docs/enterprise-tenant/customization/#domain-name), and should see the [custom domain instructions](#custom-domain) to configure the correct HTTP and MQTT endpoints.

```sh
ERROR: Custom { kind: InvalidData, error: InvalidCertificate(NotValidForName) }
Error: failed to connect to Cumulocity cloud.

Caused by:
    Connection check failed
```

#### 401 - Unauthorized

The 401 (Unauthorized) error means either the user and/or password is invalid for the configured Cumulocity IoT url that was set in the `tedge config set c8y.url <url>` command.

Check the following items to help you diagnose the root cause of the problem:

* Check the configured `c8y.url`. Copy/paste the url into a Web Browser to validate that it does open the intended Cumulocity IoT tenant
* Check your username. The user/email is case-sensitive, so make sure the user matches your configured Cumulocity IoT user
* Check your password. Use copy/paste to enter your password as this eliminates typos
* Check that you are not using a SSO user. SSO users are not permitted to use the REST API calls which the `tedge cert upload c8y` command is using. Please create a new Cumulocity IoT user via the [Administration Page](https://cumulocity.com/guides/users-guide/administration/#to-add-a-user)


#### 403 - Forbidden

The 403 (Forbidden) error means that your user/password is correct however you do not have sufficient permissions to add the %%te%%'s device certificate to the Cumulocity IoT's [Trusted certificates](https://cumulocity.com/guides/device-integration/mqtt/#device-certificates).

Your Cumulocity IoT user **MUST** be assigned the **Tenant Manager** Global Role in order to add new trusted certificates to Cumulocity IoT. Global roles can be assigned to users via the Cumulocity IoT **Administration** application under Accounts &rarr; Users &rarr; `<your username>` &rarr; Global Roles section. Below shows a screenshot of the **Tenant Manager** role that your user needs to be assigned to.

![User Global Roles](./c8y-user-globl-roles.png)

Alternatively, you can explicitly add one of the following permissions to your Cumulocity IoT user: `ROLE_TENANT_MANAGEMENT_ADMIN` OR `ROLE_TENANT_ADMIN`, however this method requires you to be familiar with the [Cumulocity IoT OpenAPI](https://cumulocity.com/api/core/#operation/postTrustedCertificateCollectionResource).

If you are still having trouble, please check out the official [Cumulocity IoT documentation](https://cumulocity.com/guides/device-integration/mqtt/#upload-your-ca-certificate).


#### Address is unreachable

If you are unable to reach Cumulocity IoT, then it is likely that your device's network is not properly configured. This could be for many different reasons, however the following checks might help you spot where the mistake is:

* Can you ping a well known DNS server?

  ```
  ping 8.8.8.8
  ```

  The exact address is not that important, it used to see if a well established/reliable IP address is reachable from your device. You may need to adjust the IP address if your ISP (Internet Service Provider) blocks it for some reason.

* Can you reach another website?

  Using Google is helpful here, as it is generally available, though you can also choose another popular/highly available website for your test.

  ```sh
  curl google.com
  ```

* Check if the configured `c8y.url` is reachable by using curl

    ```sh title="bash"
    curl "https://$(tedge config get c8y.url)/tenant/loginOptions"
    ```

    If you are having problems resolving the `c8y.url` to an IP address, then it might be worthwhile considering manually adding a nameserver to the DNS configuration file as shown below:

    ```sh title="file: /etc/resolv.conf"
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    ```

## Connect the device

Now, you are ready to run `tedge connect c8y`.
This command configures the MQTT broker:
* to establish a permanent and secure connection to the cloud,
* to forward local messages to the cloud and vice versa.

Also, if you have installed `tedge-mapper`, this command starts and enables the tedge-mapper-c8y systemd service.
At last, it sends packets to Cumulocity to check the connection.
If your device is not yet registered, you will find the digital-twin created in your tenant after `tedge connect c8y`!

```sh
sudo tedge connect c8y
```

```text title="Output"
Checking if systemd is available.

Checking if configuration for requested bridge already exists.

```

If your device does not have internet access and you want to create the bridge configuration, you can run a `tedge connect c8y` with the `--offline` flag.

```sh
sudo tedge connect c8y --offline
```

```text title="Output"
Checking if systemd is available.

Checking if configuration for requested bridge already exists.

```

If the device certificate is trusted by Cumulocity IoT, the %%te%% instance will automatically connect to the cloud once connectivity is restored.

## Sending your first telemetry data

Sending data to Cumulocity is done using MQTT over topics prefixed with `c8y`.
Any messages sent to one of these topics will be forwarded to Cumulocity.
The messages are expected to have a format specific to each topic.
Here, we use `tedge mqtt pub` a raw Cumulocity SmartRest message to be understood as a temperature of 20°C.

```sh te2mqtt formats=v1
tedge mqtt pub c8y/s/us 211,20
```

To check that this message has been received by Cumulocity,
navigate to:

Device Management &rarr; Devices &rarr; All devices &rarr; `device_id` &rarr; Measurements

You should observe a "temperature measurement" graph with the new data point.

## Next Steps

You can now:
* learn how to [send various kind of telemetry data](send-measurements.md)
  using the cloud-agnostic [%%te%% JSON data format](../understand/thin-edge-json.md),
* or have a detailed view of the [topics mapped to and from Cumulocity](../references/mappers/mqtt-topics.md#cumulocity-mqtt-topics)
  if you prefer to use directly Cumulocity specific formats and protocols.
* learn how to [add custom fragments to cumulocity](../operate/c8y/custom-fragments.md).
